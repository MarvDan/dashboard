# devcon-electron
This proyect want to create a GUI for devcon, an existing java application, using Electron and Angular.

For this purpose I considerate two options:
- Using child process with Node.js.
- Using the [node-java](https://github.com/joeferner/node-java) project to comunicate the current java project with angular and electron interface.

## Child process with Node.js
For this option I used as basis the [angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron) project.

## [node-java](https://github.com/joeferner/node-java) project
